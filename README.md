# Primuz App

A project-organization application for [Primuz Chamber Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/primuzchamberorchestra/).

If you're here to review the code, I regret to inform you that you can't run this application. It is currently in production and relies on external services. However, feel free to go spelunking in the codebase.

Just for the record: **I am not particularily proud of this code**. It is a place of exploration and many temporary solutions (turned somewhat permanent).
